# Domain Nameserver Checker
Check to see if your domains have been migrated across to your new servers quickly with a CSV file

Please Note: The purpose of this is very specific, you enter your old and new nameservers and if it doesn't match it will throw up "Investigate" line. The output is in the format for a CSV file which is beneficial to me for Excel formatting.

Ensure there are no blank lines in the CSV to prevent creating any issues
